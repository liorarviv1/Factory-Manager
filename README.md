# Factory Manager
 
 This is my first Full Stack Project. On this project I need to create 4 main pages which are: "Login", "Departments", "Employees" and "Shifts". We can manage data from the data base directly trough these pages using CRUD operations. This website is managed by users so we need to create a Login page in order for them to connect with a password. Each user has a limited number of actions per day and afterwards they are not allowed to connect for the next 24 hours. Once a user is logged-in, His name and number of actions available are shown on every page of the website. In addition to the CRUD operations on the employee page, we need to create a Search Box. This Search Box should be able to find an employee according his first name, last name or department.

The website is linked to a .NET server which is connected to my SQL Server Data Base.

The languages i used for this project are:

<ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>CSS (future versions)</li>
</ul>
Here's some screenshots from the project (Feb 13th 2022):
